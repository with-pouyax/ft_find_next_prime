# ft_find_next_prime

This repository showcases the `ft_find_next_prime` function, designed to find the smallest prime number greater than or equal to a given number. It leverages a helper function, `is_prime`, to check the primality of numbers. This implementation offers a practical approach to solving a common problem in number theory and programming contests.

## Function Overview

- **is_prime(int number):** A helper function that determines if a given number is prime.
- **ft_find_next_prime(int nb):** Finds and returns the smallest prime number that is greater than or equal to `nb`.

### Function Prototypes

```c
int is_prime(int number);

int ft_find_next_prime(int nb);
